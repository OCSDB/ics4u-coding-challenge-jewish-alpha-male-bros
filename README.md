### Computer science concept: Abstraction

Abstraction is the process of removing specific details to more attend to other details which aren’t as broad. Objects that have common features or object inheritance are examples of abstraction. The Cell constructor uses inheritance because these details defined by the lines in the constructor are general and applied to every cell, then some cells are changed, such as mines being placed or the number of neighboring mines being set.

### Math concept: Vexels and Maxels
Vectors to vexels (1D)
Matrices to Maxels(2D)

A singleton is a list consisting of a single number,ie a 1-list.A vexel is a M-set of singletons.A pixel is a 2-list of numbers.A maxel is an m-set of pixels.Maxels and Vexels are both an example of multisets of a certain kind.a vexel is a multi set whose entry is are singleton while a maxsels has multi set of pixels.we have seen many different  kinds of data structures like sets,multiset,lists ,ordered sets. Set as a whole is a assortment of things.

Lists 
List (x,y) L=[n1,n2,n3…,ny]                      
Multi set Mset(x,y)m=[n1 n2...ny]

Sets 
(x,y)s={n1 n2 ...ny}


Ordered sets                                    
oset(x,y)O={n1,n2,..ny}
